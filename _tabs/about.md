# About Me

Hi, I'm **Aman J Sonal**, currently pursuing my **Master of Computer Applications (MCA)** at **Manipal Institute of Technology**. I enjoy building mobile and full-stack solutions that combine clean design, real-time data, and smart features.

While I mostly work with **Flutter**, **Firebase**, and **cloud platforms** like AWS and GCP, I often find myself captivated by things far beyond the usual app world — like **satellite communication**, **LEO constellations**, and **maritime data systems**. These fields are still underexplored when it comes to deep tech integration, and I believe there's a lot of room for innovation.

This blog is where I’ll occasionally share things that catch my eye — from real-world satellite tracking quirks to building petabyte-scale systems that operate globally. Think of it as a personal logbook of curiosity, experiments, and discoveries.

If you're into engineering that spans from micro-interactions on mobile UIs to macro systems in orbit, I think you'll enjoy reading along.
