As a mobile developer, I’ve spent most of my time in a world defined by pixels — crafting clean interfaces, tweaking animations, and obsessing over every detail that contributes to a smooth user experience. It's a world where every millisecond and megabyte matters. But every now and then, I come across something outside my daily grind that completely hijacks my attention.

Lately, that something has been **satellites.**  
And not just the abstract idea of satellites — but real systems like **LEO constellations**, **maritime tracking**, and the **huge gap in tech adoption** in these areas.

A few weeks back, I stumbled upon a story about how **ships in the Strait of Hormuz were spoofing their AIS signals** — broadcasting misleading locations or names like "Chinese ship" to avoid attacks. That’s when I started digging, and I found myself deep in a rabbit hole of **satellite AIS data**, **RF signal intelligence**, and **maritime domain awareness systems**. It turns out, there’s an entire layer of real-time global infrastructure that’s both incredibly powerful — and surprisingly underutilized.

There’s something wild about imagining thousands of vessels silently crawling across oceans, while low-orbit satellites buzz overhead trying to make sense of their movement. Data pours in — **gigabytes per hour**, **terabytes per day** — from moving targets, intermittent connections, and uncertain locations.

And here’s the exciting part: **so much of this space is still wide open.**  
There’s a lot of raw data, but very few elegant systems to turn it into meaning. There are amazing satellites in orbit, but outdated dashboards on the ground. The backend complexity is fascinating — how do you build systems that can:

- Ingest a firehose of noisy, real-world data?
- Run analytics in near real-time across distributed assets?
- Surface critical insights without overwhelming operators?

That’s the kind of stuff I’m planning to share here.

This blog is my personal notebook — part curiosity log, part idea dump — where I’ll write about the things that catch my eye: from **satellite-based RF detection of dark ships**, to **how maritime mesh networks using Wi-Fi 6 are being tested in the Red Sea**, to the **growing role of cloud data platforms** like Snowflake and BigQuery in managing petabyte-scale telemetry.

I’m not pivoting away from pixels — they’re still my day-to-day — but I’m letting myself explore. I’ll connect the dots between what I know from software engineering and what I’m learning about these massive, underexplored systems. 

If you’re into weird tech, real-world complexity, and beautifully engineered solutions that don’t get enough attention — stay tuned. This place is going to get interesting.
